    "text": "Oh, it’s definitely *both*! Honestly, I love the audacity. Minimalism in software isn’t just about stripping things away—it’s about forcing people to confront what’s essential. But let’s talk about that README first…"
  },

    "timestamp": "00:22",
    "speaker": "HOST",
    "text": "Right! So, the README is the entire project. Why would someone do that? Is it even useful?"

    "speaker": "EXPERT",
    "text": "Well, think of it like a blank canvas, you know? If you’re teaching someone to code, starting with nothing but a doc can push them to *build* instead of copy-paste. But… um, it’s a tightrope walk. If the README’s too vague, it just becomes a maze of “you figures.”"

  {
    "timestamp": "00:52",
    "speaker": "EXPERT",
    "text": "Exactly! The Unix idea of “do one thing and do it well” applies here. The project’s so minimal it’s basically saying, “I’m just a README—*you* handle the rest.” But compared to a normal project with scripts or licenses… it’s like comparing a skeleton to a fully dressed app."

    "speaker": "EXPERT",
    "text": "If it’s smart, yeah! Like, if it explains how to generate code or spin up a GitHub Page, it’s a functional blueprint. But without setup files or a license, collaboration’s a gamble. You’re basically saying, “Trust me, I’ve got a plan.”"
