## üìù **Script Structure (3-4 minutes)**

### **üéØ Opening Hook (0:00 - 0:15)**
```
[Screen shows GitHub repository URL input]
"Ever found yourself staring at a complex GitHub repository, wondering where to start? 
What if you could just... talk to your code?"

[Cut to voice interface]
"Today, I'm showing you GitBridge - an AI-powered tool that transforms how you understand and interact with GitHub repositories."
```

### **üöÄ Main Demo Flow**

#### **1. Repository Analysis (0:15 - 0:45)**
```
[Show the main interface]
"Let's start with a React project. I'll paste the GitHub URL here..."

[Type: https://github.com/facebook/react]

"GitBridge instantly analyzes the repository structure, understanding the codebase architecture, and prepares an AI assistant that knows everything about this project."

[Show analysis loading, then completion]
"Perfect! The AI has analyzed the repository and is ready to help."
```

#### **2. Voice AI Introduction (0:45 - 1:30)**
```
[Click on "Talk" tab]
"Now for the magic - let's talk to our code. I'll click the voice interface..."

[AI introduction plays]
"Hi! I'm your AI coding assistant. I've analyzed this React repository and I'm ready to help you understand its structure, architecture, and implementation details. You can ask me anything about the codebase, from component relationships to best practices. What would you like to know?"

[Show the voice bubble states]
"Notice how the interface responds to different states - listening, processing, and speaking. The AI uses advanced speech recognition and natural language processing to understand your questions."
```

#### **3. Voice Interaction Demo (1:30 - 2:15)**
```
[Click "Start" and ask questions]

**Question 1: "What's the main architecture of this React project?"**
[AI responds with detailed explanation]

**Question 2: "How does the component hierarchy work?"**
[AI explains component structure]

**Question 3: "What are the key performance optimizations used?"**
[AI discusses React optimization techniques]

[Show real-time transcription and AI responses]
"See how the AI provides context-aware answers based on the actual codebase? It's like having a senior developer sitting next to you, explaining everything."
```

#### **4. Diagram Generation (2:15 - 2:45)**
```
[Switch to "Diagram" tab]
"But GitBridge doesn't just talk - it visualizes. Let me generate a diagram of this repository's architecture..."

[Show diagram generation]
"Using advanced AI analysis, GitBridge creates interactive Mermaid diagrams that show the relationships between components, services, and data flow."

[Demo the enhanced zoom functionality]
"Check out this smooth zoom functionality - perfect for exploring complex diagrams. You can zoom in on specific areas, reset with a double-click, or use keyboard shortcuts for precise control."
```

#### **5. Advanced Features (2:45 - 3:15)**
```
[Show export options]
"Need to share your findings? GitBridge lets you export diagrams as high-quality PNG files or copy the Mermaid code for further customization."

[Show voice customization]
"You can even customize the AI's voice and personality to match your preferences. Perfect for different use cases - from quick code reviews to deep architectural discussions."
```
