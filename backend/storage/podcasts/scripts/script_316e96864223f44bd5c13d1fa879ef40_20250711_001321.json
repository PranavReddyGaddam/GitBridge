    "timestamp": "00:45",

    "text": "Exactly. It uses **OP_RETURN** outputs, which are meant for metadata. Each message is encrypted and attached there. It’s a clever workaround—no changes to Bitcoin’s core rules."

  },
  {
    "timestamp": "01:45",
    "speaker": "EXPERT",
    "text": "Definitely. Each message is a transaction, so if many users send chats, fees spike and delays happen. They optimize with batching and compact serialization, but it’s still a trade-off."
